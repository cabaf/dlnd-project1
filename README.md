# Deep Learning Nanodegree (Udacity) - Assignment 1
## Introduction 
In this project, we'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a dataset of bike sharing rides! By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Dependencies
You only need to install [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) and run the following commands:
```
conda create --name dlnd-project1 python=3
source activate dlnd-project1
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```
To open the Notebook simply:
```
jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb
```
